Toggle STDIN between two different plain text calendar agenda formats of my own design.

# Philosophy

It's easiest to read a plain text calendar if there's some helpful indenting, but it's easiest to write tools to process it if each line has the same format. This utility lets you have the best of both worlds by toggling between the two.
